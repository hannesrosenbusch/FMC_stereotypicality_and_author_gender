The thesis investigates the stereotypical portrayal of female major characters (FMCs) in over 13,000 fictional novels across six centuries, using a large-language-model-based agent to quantify stereotypicality across dimensions like warmth, agency, appearance, and occupational rank.

## Abstract

This study investigates the stereotypical portrayal of female major characters (FMCs) in fictional literature, with a focus on differences across literary genres and author genders. Building on prior research that found that male, but not female, authors tend to portray FMCs in line with traditional gender stereotypes, this study analyzes 13,869 novels published between 1485 and 2025, with the majority originating from 1975 onwards, to examine whether this pattern can be replicated after controlling for literary genre. Gender-stereotypical portrayals focused on four key dimensions: warmth-communality, agency-competence, appearance-focus, and occupational rank. To assess these portrayals, character descriptions were evaluated using a large-language-model-based AI agent, allowing for scalable, consistent judgments of stereotypical content across a broad range of books. Findings suggested clear effects of literary genre (η2 = .0684), where genres such as Historical Fiction, Romance, and Literary Fiction tended to include more pro-stereotypical portrayals, while Science Fiction, Fantasy, Thriller, and Mystery more often featured anti-stereotypical representations. Contrary to previous work, effects of author gender were small (η2 = .0009), and male authors in the sample tended to depict FMCs as slightly less stereotypical than their female counterparts, though this result should be interpreted with caution due to potential sampling limitations. The results emphasize the importance of genre conventions in shaping FMC portrayals and underscore the need for awareness among readers, writers, and publishers regarding the ways in which literature can reflect or challenge gender norms.
